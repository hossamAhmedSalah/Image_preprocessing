    "- Images are 2D functions $f(x,y)$ in spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ in an image plane.\n",
    "-  Each function describes how colous or gray values (intensities, or brightness) vary in space.\n",
    "-  An alternative image representation is based on spatial frequencies of gray value or color variations over the image plane.\n",
    "-  spatial frequency is a characteristic of any structure that is periodic across position in space. \n",
    "-  The spatial frequency is a measure of how often sinusoidal components (as determined by the Fourier transform) of the structure repeat per unit of distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-pass filters pass high frequencies and stop low frequencies. \n",
    "  - Amplify or pass frequent changes in gray levels.\n",
    "  - Enhance the edge.\n",
    "- Low-pass filters stop high frequencies and pass low frequencies.\n",
    "  - Reduce frequent changes in gray levels.    \n",
    "  - Remove the edge (gradual slope between the two levels).\n",
    "- Applications \n",
    "  - noise removal, smoothing, and edge enhancement.\n",
    "  - Low-pass filter remove the noise:   \n",
    "    - Snow \n",
    "    - Spikes\n",
    "  - Multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time and the spatial domain.\n",
    "  - Using a small convolution is much faster than performing Fourier and multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Low-Pass filters\n",
    "- Convolovin an image with constant gay level using low-pass filters, won't change the image.\n",
    "  - No high spatial frequencies. \n",
    "- Median filter \n",
    "  - Special type of low-pass filters.\n",
    "  - Take `n√ón` area of pixels and replace the center with the median.\n",
    "  - Doesn't require convolution actually it's non-linear filter.\n",
    "  - It require sorting the pixels.\n",
    "  - Easy to change the filter size.\n",
    "  - Median filters remove noise.\n",
    "  - Beyond 5*5, slows down.\n",
    "## High-pass filters\n",
    "- sharpen thee edges.\n",
